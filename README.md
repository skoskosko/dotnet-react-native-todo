# Readme

This project has simple dotnet todo backend and react-native application. 

## Structure

Sturcture of this project is pretty messy. 

I was testing vscode devcontainers and from the beginning ran into some limitations. 

dotnet can be ran by opening dotnet folder seperatly, starting devcontainer and following instructions.

React-native can be used in same fashion.

Database is not currently in use but can be started from docker-compose
